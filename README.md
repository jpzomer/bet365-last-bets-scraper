# bet365 web scraper

Uses selenium web driver to scrap bet365 unsettled bets and downloads all bets into a csv file.

Currently using a saved HTML file, as it is against bet365 T&C the "use of automated systems or software to copy and/or extract the whole or any part of, the Website, the information or data on the Website".

May adapt at your own risk to scrap directly from the website.

I'm using this to automate my tips results spreadsheets. UK horse tips can be found on:
